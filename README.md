## Beginner Projects

1. Simple RESTful Service 
* [ ] In-Progress
  * Description: A basic REST API that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project introduces the concept of building and exposing an API endpoint for external consumers.
  *	Technologies: Spring Boot (Java), Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), or Micronaut (Kotlin)
  * Build a basic REST API with CRUD operations (e.g., a “Todo List” or “Notes” app).
* Use Cases:
    * [ ] Task management tools.
    * [ ] Shopping list apps.
    * [ ] Task trackers for personal use.
    * [ ] Basic note-taking applications.
    * [ ] Learning how to build RESTful APIs.
2. Multiple RESTful Microservices
   * Split the API from project 1 into two separate services: one for managing users and one for managing todos/notes.
3. Service Discovery Using Consul or Eureka
   * Add a service registry (e.g., Consul or Eureka) for automatic service discovery between two microservices.
4. Communication with HTTP and REST
   * Develop two microservices that communicate with each other using HTTP and REST endpoints.
5.	Database Per Service
* Implement separate databases for each microservice (e.g., user service with PostgreSQL 
 and task service with MongoDB).
6. API Gateway Integration
   * Introduce an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Zuul, or NGINX) to manage external traffic routing to your microservices.
7. Circuit Breaker Implementation
   * Add a circuit breaker pattern to handle microservice failures gracefully (e.g., using Hystrix or Resilience4j).
8. Health Check Endpoints
   * Create health check endpoints for each microservice and integrate them with your service discovery tool.
9. Dockerize Microservices
   * Containerize your microservices using Docker, ensuring they can run independently on different machines.
10. Logging Using ELK Stack
 * Integrate logging for all microservices using the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to monitor logs centrally.

## Intermediate Projects

11.	Load Balancing with NGINX
* Set up load balancing across multiple instances of the same microservice using NGINX.
12.	Asynchronous Communication with RabbitMQ or Kafka
 * Convert microservices to use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous event-driven communication.
13.	API Versioning and Deprecation
 * Add versioning to your API and demonstrate how you can deprecate old endpoints while still supporting new ones.
14.	Distributed Tracing Using OpenTelemetry
 * Implement distributed tracing across microservices to visualize call flows and performance using OpenTelemetry or Jaeger.
15.	Configuration Management with Spring Cloud Config
 * Centralize the configuration of your microservices using a tool like Spring Cloud Config or HashiCorp Vault.
16.	Centralized Authentication with OAuth2
 * Implement OAuth2 authentication, using a service like Keycloak or Auth0, across all microservices.
17.	Rate Limiting in API Gateway
 * Add rate limiting in the API Gateway to manage client request throttling for different microservices.
18.	Microservices Metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
 * Implement Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for dashboards to monitor microservice performance.
19.	Event Sourcing with CQRS Pattern
 * Build a microservice using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing patterns for data consistency.
20.	Fault Tolerance with Retry and Timeout Policies
 * Introduce retry and timeout policies to handle temporary service unavailability and ensure fault tolerance.

## Advanced Projects
21.	Container Orchestration with Kubernetes
 * Deploy your microservices on Kubernetes, and implement scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates.
22.	Service Mesh with Istio
 * Add a service mesh (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) for secure service-to-service communication, traffic management, and observability.
23.	Distributed Caching with Redis
 * Introduce Redis as a distributed caching layer to improve performance across microservices.
24.	Zero Downtime Deployments
 * Implement blue/green or canary deployments in your Kubernetes cluster for zero downtime deployments.
25.	API Rate Limiting and Quotas with Redis
 * Implement rate limiting and quotas using Redis for managing API traffic and protecting microservices from abuse.
26.	Distributed Transactions with Sagas
 * Use the Saga pattern to handle distributed transactions across microservices, ensuring eventual consistency.
27.	Security Hardening with Mutual TLS
 * Secure the communication between microservices using mutual TLS for service-to-service encryption.
28.	Multi-Tenancy Support
 * Build microservices that support multiple tenants, ensuring data isolation and separate access control for each tenant.
29.	Chaos Engineering with Gremlin
 * Implement chaos engineering practices by introducing failure testing (e.g., using Gremlin or Chaos Monkey) to improve resilience.
30.	Serverless Microservices with AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions
 * Explore serverless architecture by deploying some microservices as AWS Lambda functions or Google Cloud Functions, and compare the trade-offs between serverless and containerized microservices.
